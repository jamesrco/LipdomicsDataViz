# LipdomicsDataViz
Scripts for data processing, visualization, and statistical analysis of lipidomics data.

Scripts in the subrepo [LipidomicsDataViz/LOBSTAHS](https://github.com/jamesrco/LipidomicsDataViz/tree/master/LOBSTAHS) were used for statistical analysis and data visualization of results in Collins, J.R., B.R. Edwards, H.F. Fredricks, and B.A.S. Van Mooy, "Semi-untargeted discovery and identification of oxidative stress biomarkers using a lipidomics pipeline for complex datasets," after the data were processed using the [LOBSTAHS R package](https://github.com/vanmooylipidomics/LOBSTAHS).
